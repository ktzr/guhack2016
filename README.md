#Glasgow University Hackathon 2016

## Morgan Stanley Challenge

## Specification
Our challenge consisted of picking a charity and developping a relevant kinect application. We decided to make an application for Stroke.org in order to facilitate physical therapy for stroke victims that suffer from loss of essential motor skills.

## Technologies
Visual Studio, Kinect Libraries for tracking body motion and displaying colour image.
